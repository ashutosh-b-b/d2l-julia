    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Pooling is an exceedingly simple operation. It does exactly what its name indicates, aggregate results over a window of values. All convolution semantics, such as strides and padding apply in the same way as they did previously. Note that pooling is indifferent to channels, i.e., it leaves the number of channels unchanged and it applies to each channel separately. Lastly, of the two popular pooling choices, max-pooling is preferable to average pooling, as it confers some degree of invariance to output. A popular choice is to pick a pooling window size of $2 \\times 2$ to quarter the spatial resolution of output. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are many more ways of reducing resolution beyond pooling. For instance, in stochastic pooling :cite:`Zeiler.Fergus.2013` and fractional max-pooling :cite:`Graham.2014` aggregation is combined with randomization. This can slightly improve the accuracy in some cases. Lastly, as we will see later with the attention mechanism, there are more refined ways of aggregating over outputs, e.g., by using the alignment between a query and representation vectors. \n",
